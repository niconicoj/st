This is my personal st build.

* It adds font ligatures support because I love Fira Code.
* it uses gruvbox material as a color scheme because I love gruvbox material.
* It adds global clipboard support and backscroll with mouse wheel because I am a normie noob.
* It adds alpha config for the bling factor.
